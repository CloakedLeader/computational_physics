# Computational Physics Simulations

This repository contains simulations and computational methods I am learning/practicing. I cover a wide range of topics in physics and methods such as finite difference method, Monte Carlo simulations and the Ising Model.

## Motivation

I aim to gain hands-on experince with numerical solutions to physical problems and to explore current areas of computational physics research. I would also like to study machine learning and AI-methods for general interest.

## Installation

This project requires Python 3.x and at least the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlit
- scipy
- pandas
