# Computational Physics Simulations

This repository is my computational physics portfolio, covering numerical methods, mathematical modelling and programming. I cover a wide range of topics in physics and maths via methods such as finite difference method, Monte Carlo simulations and the Ising Model.

## Motivation

I aim to gain hands-on experince with numerical solutions to physical problems and to explore current areas of computational physics research. With the final goal being using computational methods for my studies in theoretical physics.

## Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Topics | Demo |
|---------|-------------|--------|------|
| [N-Body Simulation](projects/n_body_simulation) | Simulates gravitational interactions using Runge-Kutta integrators. Simulates particle motion dynamically. | Classical Mechanics, ODEs | ![nbody](projects/n_body_simulation/demo.gif) |
| [2D Ising Model](projects/2d_ising_model) | Monte Carlo simulation of magnetic spins to study phase transitions. | Statisical Mechanics, Monte Carlo | - |
